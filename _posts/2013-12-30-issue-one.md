Happy holidays, friends and fellow robots! With the snow piling up and the year coming to a close, Lullabot is reflecting on a jam-packed 2013. We marked our fourth turn at bat with the [GRAMMY awards](https://www.lullabot.com/blog/news/fourth-grammy-drupal-and-lullabot), rolled out fresh responsive designs for clients like [Martha Stewart Living](http://www.marthastewart.com) and [Intel](http://tizen.org), launched a mobile-friendly, Drupal-powered [MSNBC.com](https://www.lullabot.com/work/msnbc), and much, much more! We’ve grown by leaps and bounds, and this November we gathered the entire team in sunny Mexico for a week of brainstorming, learning, and relaxation. Staying connected is hard work for a 40+ person distributed agency, but meetings by the pool definitely help…

In this issue of the newsletter, Lullabot’s Creative Director Jared Ponchot gives a peek at what the design and content strategy teams have been up to, and we gather up a collection of useful articles, conference sessions, and resources to carry you into January. As we wrap up this year and get ready for 2014, we’d like to wish all of our friends Happy Holidays. Thanks for helping make this year great!

# A Fireside Chat with Jared Ponchot

  Jared Ponchot lives in Atlanta, Georgia with his wife, two children, and two dogs. At Lullabot, he’s in charge of making things make more sense.

<strong class="question">2013 has been a big year for Lullabot, and your design team has been a huge part of that. Are there any projects you're particularly proud of?</strong>

_The MSNBC.com launch. I consulted early in the project and my role was quite focused, but it wasn't going to be responsive when we started. There just wasn't room in the timeline to implement separate designs for individual device types, though, and the biggest win was getting buy-in to launch a major media site with a responsive, mobile-first design._

_Another interesting project we worked on was for the National Association of Music Merchandisers. It was an opportunity for Lullabot to carry a project from the initial strategy work all the way through to full design implementation._

_A lot of the projects we work on are so huge, with multiple embedded teams and partners, that's just not a possibility. This time, we managed the entire process and helped shape what the project should be. It was tremendously rewarding; I don't think I've ever had such clarity of purpose!_

<strong class="question">You're Lullabot's Creative Director, but your history includes time as a Drupal site builder. How does that affect your approach to planning and design?</strong>

_I think it's really helpful to understand how a site actually comes together, because you begin to think about the structural parts beyond what you see on the screen. It changes your palette a little bit._

_The reason I became fascinated with content strategy, and started talking about it driving the design process, was my early experience building with Drupal. The way it handles building out a content model, the way it allows you to create and deliver content, got me thinking about content systems a lot. It changed the way I designed and where I began in my process; I started trying to figure out the system behind the content before throwing shapes onto a screen._

<strong class="question">Is there a particular technique your team has used to streamline the process?</strong>

_Keep your wireframes really lightweight, and evaluate every single one with real content. As you begin to plug in real content, you realize a lot of things. Maybe the content you imagine doesn't actually exist, or an essential element is extremely unique and doesn't fit the content model. You spot the oddballs that will be difficult to update and maintain._

_The more you can design with real content, the easier it is to develop a usable design system around it._

<strong class="question">If you could snap your fingers, what frustration would you eliminate in 2014?</strong>

_I'd give myself a magic "Make this work in Internet Explorer 8" button!_
